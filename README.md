**What does this project do?**
------------------------------------
Re-created  the _"Match Madness"_ in DuoLingo using React


[ This game can re-inforce vocabulary, formulas, language script, simple math and so on... using a matching technique ]

=>The words to be matched are picked from a .json file and the order is scrambled. User matches the correct tiles. 

=>Admin can decide how many words to show and how many rounds in a game

**How it works**
----------------------------------------
**Start screen: List of tiles to match**

---------------------------------------
**Wrong choice: Tiles indicate mistake**

**Right Choice: Tiles get disabled**

-------------------------------------------
**End Screen: When all rounds are played and tiles matched**

-------------------------------------------

**Planned Future Enhancements**
-------------------------------------------

=> Simplify getting the match words i.e. from text file instead of formatted .json 


=> Admin section to update the words to show and rounds to play
